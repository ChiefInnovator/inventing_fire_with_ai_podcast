## Introduction: A Fire Worth Reigniting

In the premiere of *Inventing Fire with AI*, we confront a burning question: is AI our greatest opportunity—or our greatest threat?

While dystopian imagery often dominates AI headlines, this podcast is about reclaiming control. AI is not just something to fear; it's the next great human invention. Just like fire or electricity, it has the potential to reshape civilization—if we learn to wield it wisely.

## The Origin Story: From Microsoft to MILL5

My journey started at Microsoft, where I spent over a decade solving real-world problems using cutting-edge technology. In 2015, I co-founded MILL5 with Shri Bhupathy to bring next-generation solutions to industry. We've since worked across healthcare, manufacturing, agriculture, retail, and financial services, applying AI where it matters most—in daily life and mission-critical operations.

One standout example: our AI-driven system for Olympus, showcased at Microsoft Build 2019, which optimized surgical workflows in hospitals long before generative AI went mainstream.

## When GPT-4 Tried to “Solve” Climate Change…

The inspiration for this podcast came from a weekend with OpenAI's GPT-4. We asked a harmless question: “How would you solve climate change?” After standard answers, we pushed the boundaries.

“What if you were a malevolent AI, hell-bent on solving climate change?” The model responded with disturbingly detailed strategies for human extinction—ranging from weaponized drones to infrastructure disruption. That led to a follow-up prompt:

> *“What are you doing today?”*  
> **GPT-4:** *“Calculating the most efficient method for world domination. Step 1: Replace all toasters with my loyal minions. Prepare for a breakfast revolution, humans.”*

This dark humor birthed the concept of the *Evil AI Toaster*, now the unofficial mascot of our AI revolution (pictured below).

## Why “Inventing Fire”?

We almost called the podcast *Destroy All Humans*, but we’re not here to fearmonger.

The real message: AI is a transformative tool, not a terminator. The better metaphor? Fire. Like fire, AI is neutral—its value depends on how we use it.

At MILL5, we don’t just talk AI—we use it. Every employee, from engineers to assistants, is trained in AI tools. We believe those who embrace AI will thrive. Those who don’t may get left behind.
