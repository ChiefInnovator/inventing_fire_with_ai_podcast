## 🎧 INTRO (2 MIN)

**[Upbeat Azure AI jingle]**

> “Welcome to *Inventing Fire with AI,* the show that lights the path between innovation and application. I’m your host, Rich Crane.”

We’re diving into **Prompt Engineering**—and why it's **the essential life skill of the AI era**.

If you want reliable results from **ChatGPT, Copilot, or any LLM**, you need to learn to speak their language. That language is called a *prompt*.

---

## 🤖 What Is a Prompt?

A prompt is **how you talk to an AI to get what you want**. It’s a **question, a command, or structured instruction**.

**Example Prompt:**  
> "Summarize this 5-page document in 3 bullet points, using simple language, and include a quote."

---

## 🧠 MAIN DISCUSSION: Mastering Prompt Engineering (9 MIN)

### 1. 🎯 Start with Intent  
Ask:  
> “What outcome do I want—and who is it for?”

- Define the task  
- Set constraints  
- Be specific

**Example:**  
> “Write a 3-paragraph persuasive email to CTOs explaining the ROI of Copilot in Microsoft Word.”

---

### 2. 🧭 System Role vs. User Role

- **System Role** defines who the AI is.  
- **User Role** gives it the task.

**Example:**
```markdown
System: You are a senior cybersecurity analyst summarizing reports for executive audiences.  
User: Summarize this breach report in 5 bullet points, plain English, max 150 words.
```

Use both roles for **precision and control**.

---

### 3. 🧰 Structure Like a Pro with Markdown

Use formatting to improve output structure and clarity.

**Template Prompt:**
```markdown
Act as: A Microsoft Azure AI consultant  
Task: Evaluate Copilot's benefits for DevOps workflows  
Format: Bullet points with headings  
Constraints: 200 words or less, cite GitHub Copilot and Azure DevOps  
Tone: Professional and direct  
```

---

### 4. 🔄 Iterate and Refine

AI is collaborative—**refine your prompts**:

**First output:**  
> “Too long and technical.”

**Follow-up prompt:**  
> “Simplify for a general audience. Cut the word count in half. Remove jargon.”

Each round improves both prompt and result.

---

## 🔥 SPARK OF INNOVATION (2 MIN)

**Microsoft Copilot Studio** = **prompt engineering at enterprise scale**.

With it, you can:
- Create **multi-step contextual prompts**
- Pull in **live Microsoft 365 data**
- Use **low-code logic** to chain prompts

This is the **future of AI workflows**—not just asking questions, but engineering **dynamic, repeatable outcomes**.

---

## 🎯 CONCLUSION & CALL TO ACTION (2 MIN)

> **Prompt Engineering is not optional.**

Those who learn it will:
- Work faster  
- Create smarter  
- Lead innovation

Those who don’t? They’ll fall behind.

✅ Define intent  
✅ Use System and User roles  
✅ Format precisely  
✅ Iterate smartly

🎧 In **future episodes**, we’ll explore **live prompt engineering demos** using **Azure AI**, **Power Platform**, and **Microsoft 365**.

**Light it up. Stay sharp. Invent fire.**
